                <p class="p3 ">19/01/2020</u>
                <br> <br> 
                
                <p class="p4">Sometimes it seems like every computer science student is either born with the ability to know how to do web development or they've had no experience in the area at all but still back themselves to be able to create a website within a few days. 
                I am in the latter group, with an aspiration to code as though it were as natural as breathing. Every time I hear the words "React", "Angular", "AWS", "stack" and "framework" I was reminded of a time that I looked up those words but forgot them. 
                This weekend, I decided to do what I could to improve my skills in web development by making the website you're reading this on. 
                <br><br>
                <p class="p3 ">Learning resources</u>
                <p class="p4">Prior to creating this website, I had taken Codecademy courses in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and I followed Codecademy's tutorial on how to deploy a website using github.
                I found Codecademy was useful for familiarising myself with the process of creating something for the first time, but is quite far removed from coding in the real world - the differences are just too stark and imperfect.
                Nonetheless, it made for a good starting point. 
                <br><br>
                <p class="p3 ">Outsourced components</u>  
                <p class="p4">I decided to go with the Jekyll framework and AWS Route 53 to deploy my final website, because I knew other people in my class who had recommended those services to me. 
                <br><br>
                <p class="p3 ">Problems and solutions</u>
                <p class="p4 col">1) I thought I understood CSS and HTML until I started using it. In reality, my process consisted of a lot of trial and error. Questions like "Which div is this influencing?" and "why is my margin not moving?" were frequent. 
                My trial and error method worked well enough to get a result that was in the ball-park of what I was trying to achieve, and I suspect with more practice I won't have to guess as much when it comes to trying to change the layout of my website.
                Below is an example of one of the many mishaps I encountered with this project.
                <br>
                <div class="centre"><img src="images/blog_images/stretched-website.png" width="800px"></div>

                <br>
                <p class="p4 col">2) When I started making pages and menus for my website, I quickly found that creating a universal footer and header were going to be important time savers.
                To implement this, I switched to from HTML to PHP. I'm sure there were many ways to do this but that was one of the suggestions according to StackOverflow. This surprised me as a solution, because I thought that HTML was more flexible than PHP. This could still be true, but as soon as it started working I let my questions fall to the wayside and began working on something else.  
                <br><br>
                3) I wanted to use a corner of my website to showcase some of my drawings, but wanted to add some extra functionality so that users could enlarge and click forwards and backwards through the images in the gallery. 
                I found that a "modal lightbox" was what I was wanted - modal meaning being scrollable, and lightbox meaning that an black screen is laid over the website so that the image could be seen without distractions.
                
                <p class="p3 ">Ideas for future enhancements:</p>   

                <p class="p4 col" width="400">
                    1) Scaling to screen size. The website appears the same size regardless of the screen size.
                    <br><br>
                    2) Mobile functionality - UPDATE (28/02/2020): Mobile dropdown menu added
                    <br><br>
                    3) Consistent arrow placement. Right now, images in the lightbox are off-centre and the placement of the prev/next arrows are dependent on the size of the image.</li>
                    <br><br>

                <p class="p3 ">Takeaways</u>
                <p class="p4">So, it turns of web development is hard to be good at, but achievable if your expectations are low.
                I found the process more satisfying than many back-end projects because of the visual and interactive aspect of creating a website. I learnt that the inspect element is very useful, and as always, that the answer is probably on StackOverflow. 
                A lot of time was spent trying to change the placement of boxes on the screen, and getting the padding to how I envisioned my website to be, but that is to be expected for a first time. 
                Overall, I am happy for the outcome!
